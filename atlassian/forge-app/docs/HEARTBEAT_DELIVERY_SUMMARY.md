## 📊 Heartbeat Data Model

### Two-Layer Timing Model

**Layer 1: Platform Trigger (5 minutes)**
- Forge scheduler fires every 5 minutes (manifest: `interval: fiveMinute`)
- Recorded in `lastTriggerAt` (timestamp) and `triggerCount` (count)

**Layer 2: Meaningful Check Cadence (15 minutes)**
- FirstTry runs meaningful checks every 15 minutes via deterministic cadence gate
- Recorded in `lastCadenceCheckAt` (timestamp) and `runCount` (count)
- Staleness threshold: 30 minutes (2 × 15 min)

**Why two layers?**
- Forge doesn't support native 15-minute intervals
- We enforce a deterministic gate in storage to skip 2 out of 3 platform pings
- This creates effective 15-minute meaningful checks
- Users see BOTH intervals to prevent misleading claims about frequency

### Storage Key
```
firsttry:heartbeat:<cloudId>
```

### Record Shape
```typescript
{
  status: "RUNNING" | "INITIALIZING" | "DEGRADED",
  lastSuccessAt?: string,         // UTC ISO 8601
  lastCheckAt?: string,           // UTC ISO 8601 (legacy compat)
  lastTriggerAt?: string,         // UTC ISO 8601 (platform ping)
  lastCadenceCheckAt?: string,    // UTC ISO 8601 (meaningful check)
  firstSuccessAt?: string,        // UTC ISO 8601
  runCount?: number,              // Meaningful checks
  triggerCount?: number,          // Platform pings
  snapshotCount?: number,
  cadenceIntervalMinutes?: number, // Fixed: 15
  lastError?: string,             // Max 300 chars, sanitized
  updatedAt?: string              // UTC ISO 8601
}
```

**Rules:**
- Missing fields remain missing (not null)
- All timestamps stored as UTC ISO 8601
- Counters are best-effort (eventual consistency)
- Errors are sanitized (no secrets, truncated, single-line)
- Platform pings recorded ALWAYS; meaningful checks recorded when cadence due

## ⏱️ Timing Rules

### Storage
- All timestamps stored as UTC ISO 8601
- Example: `2025-01-03T14:30:45.123Z`

### Display
- **If browser timezone available:** Format to local time with timezone name
  - Example: `Jan 3, 2025, 09:30:45 AM PST`
- **If browser timezone unavailable:** Display UTC with explicit label
  - Example: `2025-01-03T14:30:45.123Z UTC`

Never label as "local" unless timezone actually used.

---

## 🚨 Staleness Detection

**Platform Trigger Interval:** 5 minutes (from `phase5-auto-scheduler: fiveMinute`)

**Meaningful Check Cadence:** 15 minutes (deterministic cadence gate)

**Staleness Threshold:** 2 × 15 = 30 minutes

**Rule:** If `(now - lastCadenceCheckAt) > 30 minutes`, displayed status is `DEGRADED (STALE)`

**Important:** Staleness uses only `lastCadenceCheckAt` (meaningful checks), not `lastTriggerAt` (platform pings). This prevents false negatives if pings are occurring but checks are blocked.

This overrides stored status to prevent false "RUNNING" signal when checks have stopped.

---

## 📋 Status Computation

```
If no heartbeat record exists
  → INITIALIZING

Else if cadenceIntervalMinutes is known AND (now - lastCadenceCheckAt) > 2 × cadenceIntervalMinutes (30 min)
  → DEGRADED (STALE)

Else
  → stored status (RUNNING, INITIALIZING, or DEGRADED)
```

**Never shows RUNNING without a recent meaningful check (within 30 minutes).**

**Note:** Computation uses `lastCadenceCheckAt` (meaningful check time), not `lastTriggerAt` (platform ping time).

---

## 🤫 Data Availability Disclosure

The gadget displays a section listing all UNKNOWN fields with reason codes:

**Reason Codes:**
- `STORAGE_EMPTY` – No heartbeat record created yet
- `NOT_YET_OBSERVED` – Event hasn't occurred since installation
- `NOT_DECLARED` – Required environment variable missing
- `NOT_AVAILABLE_IN_CONTEXT` – Forge context doesn't provide identifier (e.g., cloudId)
- `NOT_IMPLEMENTED_IN_CODEBASE` – Feature doesn't exist in code

**Display:**
- If no unknowns: "✓ All fields available."
- If any unknown: Listed as `<Field> — UNKNOWN — <ReasonCode>`

---

## 🧾 Trust Boundaries (Always Visible)

```
✓ Read-only operation
✓ No Jira writes
✓ No configuration changes
✓ No policy enforcement
✓ No recommendations
✓ No external network calls / no data egress
✓ No admin actions required
```

These are **unconditionally displayed** and are **architectural facts** (not computed).

## 🔄 Integration Points

### Phase 5 Scheduler

Every 5 minutes (platform trigger):

```typescript
import { recordPlatformPing } from '../ops/heartbeat_recorder';
import { recordHeartbeatCheck } from '../ops/heartbeat_recorder';
import { isCadenceDue } from '../ops/cadence_gate';

// ALWAYS called every 5 min:
await recordPlatformPing(cloudId);

// CONDITIONALLY called when cadence due (~every 15 min):
if (await isCadenceDue(cloudId)) {
  // Run meaningful check...
  await recordHeartbeatCheck(cloudId, {
    success: checkPassed,
    error: checkPassed ? undefined : errorMessage,
  });
}
```

### Snapshot Handlers (Daily/Weekly)

After snapshot persisted, call:

```typescript
import { recordSnapshot } from '../ops/heartbeat_recorder';

await recordSnapshot(cloudId);
```

**Integration guide:** See [HEARTBEAT_INTEGRATION.md](HEARTBEAT_INTEGRATION.md)

## ⚠️ Important Limitations

### Counters Are Best-Effort
- Forge Storage has eventual consistency
- No atomic writes or compare-and-set
- Counters converge over time but may lag during concurrent updates
- Gadget displays `(best-effort counter)` label

### Not a Compliance Tool
- Proves **checks are happening**, not **what checks are doing**
- Does not prove compliance
- Does not prove data accuracy
- Does not make recommendations

### Transparency, Not Enforcement
- No Jira writes
- No configuration changes
- No policy enforcement
- Read-only observation only

---

## 🖼️ UI Behavior

- **Static layout** – No dynamic features, no state mutations
- **No buttons** – No refresh, no generate, no configure
- **No inputs** – No form fields, no editable content
- **No links** – Cannot navigate away
- **Read-only** – Cannot interact with the Jira instance

The gadget cannot be misconfigured. All issues are in the data source.

---

## 🧪 What's NOT Included (Intentional)

❌ No snapshot implementation (Phase 6 already exists)  
❌ No scheduler implementation (already exists)  
❌ No enforcement engine (outside scope)  
❌ No recommendations (outside scope)  
❌ No configuration UI (read-only only)  
❌ No scheduled exports (out of scope)  
❌ No custom alerts (not needed for transparency)  

---

## ✅ Verification Checklist
