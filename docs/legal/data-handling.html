<h1>Data Handling</h1>

<p><strong>Last Updated</strong>: January 2, 2026</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This document describes how Firsttry handles data as an Atlassian Forge application.</p>

<h2>Data Flow</h2>

<h3>Input</h3>

<p>The App reads data from Jira Cloud via Atlassian's REST APIs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issue metadata (keys, summaries, descriptions, custom fields)</li>
<li>Project information</li>
<li>User context (as provided by Forge)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Scope</strong>: Data access is limited to permissions granted via declared Forge scopes in the app manifest.</p>

<h3>Transform</h3>

<p>Data is analyzed for governance patterns and reporting purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Issue classification and categorization</li>
<li>Metadata extraction and aggregation</li>
<li>Governance metrics calculation</li>
</ul>

<p>All processing occurs within the Atlassian Forge runtime environment.</p>

<h3>Storage</h3>

<p>Analyzed data and governance reports are stored using:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Atlassian Forge Storage API</strong>: App-scoped key-value storage</li>
<li><strong>Isolation</strong>: Storage is isolated per Jira tenant</li>
<li><strong>Management</strong>: Storage is managed by Atlassian infrastructure</li>
</ul>

<p>Storage quota limits are determined by Atlassian's Forge platform policies.</p>

<h3>Output</h3>

<p>Output is delivered through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Forge UI components rendered in Jira</li>
<li>Administrative dashboards within Jira</li>
<li>Reports generated within the App's UI</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>No External Output</strong>: The App does not transmit data to external third-party services. All network communication is limited to Atlassian-hosted APIs.</p>

<h2>Data Security</h2>

<p>Security is provided by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Atlassian Forge's sandboxed runtime environment</li>
<li>Atlassian's infrastructure security controls</li>
<li>App-scoped storage isolation per tenant</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>In-App Storage</strong>: Data persists in Forge storage until explicitly deleted or the app is uninstalled</li>
<li><strong>Retention Policies</strong>: Specific retention periods vary based on data type and operational needs</li>
<li><strong>Deletion</strong>: Data can be removed by uninstalling the App or through app-specific cleanup operations</li>
</ul>

<p>For storage growth behavior and quota handling, see the platform dependencies documentation.</p>

<h2>Data Subject Rights</h2>

<p>Users may request:</p>
<ul>
<li>Information about what data is stored</li>
<li>Deletion of stored data (by uninstalling the App)</li>
<li>Clarification of data handling practices</li>
</ul>

<p>Contact: contact@firsttry.run</p>

<h2>Third-Party Data Sharing</h2>

<p><strong>No Third-Party Sharing</strong>: The App does not share data with third-party services outside the Atlassian ecosystem.</p>

<p>Network access is limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Atlassian Forge APIs</li>
<li>Atlassian Jira Cloud APIs (as permitted by declared scopes)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Compliance Notes</h2>

<ul>
<li>The App is designed as a read-only, informational tool</li>
<li>It does not modify Jira data (no writes, creates, or deletes)</li>
<li>It does not enforce policies or apply automated remediation</li>
<li>Compliance outcomes depend on proper configuration and interpretation by qualified personnel</li>
</ul>

<h2>Changes to Data Handling</h2>

<p>Data handling practices may change as the App evolves. Updates to this document will be published with version changes.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Platform Dependency</strong>: Data handling is constrained by Atlassian Forge platform capabilities and limitations. Service availability depends on Atlassian Cloud and Forge platform.</p>
