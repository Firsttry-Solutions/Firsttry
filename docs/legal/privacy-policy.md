# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated**: January 2, 2026

## Overview

This privacy policy describes how Firsttry ("the App") handles data when deployed as an Atlassian Forge application.

## Data Collection and Usage

### Data Read from Jira

The App reads Jira metadata including:
- Issue keys, summaries, descriptions, and custom fields
- Project information and metadata
- User context (as provided by Atlassian Forge)

This data is read for informational and governance reporting purposes only.

### Data Storage

Data is stored using Atlassian Forge's app-scoped storage API. Storage is managed by Atlassian infrastructure and is isolated per Jira tenant installation.

### What the App Does NOT Do

- **No Jira Writes**: The App does not create, modify, or delete Jira issues
- **No Policy Enforcement**: The App does not automatically enforce policies or apply remediation actions
- **No External Egress**: The App does not transmit data to external third-party services outside the Atlassian ecosystem

## Data Retention

Data retention varies based on operational needs and storage configurations. For specific retention details, refer to the Data Handling documentation.

## Your Rights

As a Jira Cloud customer, you maintain control over your instance and can uninstall the App at any time. For data deletion requests or questions about data handling, contact us at the address below.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

**Note**: This App is hosted on Atlassian Forge infrastructure. Atlassian's own privacy policies and data handling practices also apply to the underlying platform services.
